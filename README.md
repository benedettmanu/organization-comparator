# Organization Comparator

## Introduction

Develop a program that, by entering the following information from two different different organizations (Organization X and Organization Y):
* Number of cycles of each RISC-V instruction format;
* Clock time;
* Instruction memory file (ROM) in machine language (binary or 
hexadecimal).

Present the following results:
* The number of total cycles spent by each program in each organization;
* The average cycles per instruction (CPI) for the program in each organization;
* Which organization performed best and how much better. 

# Development Environment

* Create a `doc.txt` file in the root of the project with the contents of the instruction memory file.
